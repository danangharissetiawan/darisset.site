very fast, just a few steps!

Some of Django's Darisset Blog CMS functionality is:

- **different virtual environments** for development, testing and production
- **Internationalization** and **localization** to support multiple languages
- Project structure
- **HTML5 Boilerplate**
- Template inheritance
- **robots.txt and human.txt configurable**
- **organized sitemap.txt**
- **SEO**
- **Responsive web design**
- **already using Boostrap 4**

In addition, you can learn how to conceptualize this CMS **step by step** manually due to structured code writing.
